# TODO: expand this test-case to do ping between two HelenOS hosts.
# It would be best if that would be possible in host userspace
# without root privileges.
# Following commands
# (guest 1) -netdev socket,id=n1,listen=:8010 -device e1000,netdev=n1,mac=3c:08:51:05:24:8a
# (guest 2) -netdev socket,id=n1,connect=127.0.0.1:8010 -device e1000,netdev=n1,mac=3c:08:51:05:24:8b
# launches two guests that - with IP addresses in the same subnet - see 
# ach other. However, it seems that connecting third guess is impossible
# hence this is not a general solution.
